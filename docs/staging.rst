Staging
=======

The *staging layer* of Deet is implemented as a native SQL-Database engine,
featuring a DB-API 2.0 interface with full SQL:2016 support, a vertical data
storage manager and real-time encryption. This allows the data analysis
application to integrate a variety of different data sources, by using a unified
data interface (and SQL dialect).
