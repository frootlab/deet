"""DB-API 2.0 database interfaces.

This module is a reference for the required exceptions, base classes, module
attributes and module functions specified in the Python Database API (DB-API)
Specification 2.0 :PEP:`249`.

Module attributes:
    apilevel:
        String constant stating the supported DB-API level.
    threadsafety:
        Integer constant stating the level of thread safety the interface
        supports.
    paramstyle:
        String constant stating the type of parameter marker formatting expected
        by the interface.

Constructor function:
    connect(...) -> Connection
        Constructor for creating a connection to the database. Returns a
        Connection Object. It takes a number of parameters which are database
        dependent.

        The number of rows to fetch per call is specified by the parameter. If
        it is not given, the cursor's arraysize determines the number of rows to
